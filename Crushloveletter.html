                <h5 style= "color: darkred"> When I first laid my eyes on you, I was in great awe. Your features and personality had me feeling so smitten I could not help myself but fall for you. You had the qualities of a girl I have always dreamt of. Everything you say and do makes me feel enamored. There is no other person in this world that may come as close to your perfection that I greatly admire. 
                <br>
                <br>
				You may not know this but you have touched my heart and left me speechless. I couldn’t decide what move I should make next ever since you have stolen my heart. Although you run around my mind all day and keep me distracted, I wouldn’t mind for I enjoy dreaming about you, all day and night. How I wish you would feel the same way for me the way I feel for you and that you may choose me as the one to treat you to the best of things; And that sooner or later, you and I shall have an abounding life together as one. I promise to always treat you right and I hope destiny will bring us closer together.
