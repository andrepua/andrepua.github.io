                    We were clueless strangers from different lands, searching for love in distant places. One fateful 
                    day, destiny has come to us and changed our lives. Niether did any of us know we would find each other 
                    and have one another. I saw the qualities in you that complemented me and it was at this moment, 
                    I knew, I found the one!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meeting you was a rocky start for me. I barely had the courage to open myself up for you. You were rather 
                    intimidating to begin with since everything was a start for us. Deep down, I couldn't deny myself for you
                    and think about you as somebody who could be part of my life. Slowly, I took initiative and confessed my
                    feelings for you. Little did I know that you would reciprocate your feelings for me. Ever since then, we 
                    fell for each other and have grown into one another's roots, constantly taking each others' time going to 
                    different destinations, trying new things and making memories together. You are the my other half that
                    completes me and gives me love. I long to spend my life with you, making each and every day special.
