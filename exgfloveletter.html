                    Hello. How are you? It has been a while since we have parted our ways. Time has treated us quite cruelly considering how difficult it was for us to let go of each other. All the times we spent being together, the jokes we told each other, the places we have gone, and every other distant memory of us has fallen apart into a thousand pieces. Although I wish to no longer have you back in my life, the thought of you lingers deep within my mind, keeping me awake and unaware of myself. There is no other girl I will ever come across that will compare to you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Wherever you are, whatever the time is, I wish nothing but the best for you. Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead. Despite how painful it may be, I want to remember you for the rest of my life as somebody who has taught me to be a much stronger person and someone who helped me develop from my failures and mistakes. I am grateful to have you in my life and happy to spend a part of it with you. Who knows when we will ever come across each other. Who knows if we are better off apart, but one thing's for sure, our time spent together was not wasted but rather an experience for both of us.
                    I just want to say: Thank you, next.
